is way to easily implements this kind of flow:\r\n * ```\r\n * Loading -> Success | Error\r\n * ```\r\n * The component is based on a status that can take one of these value: `loading | success | error`\r\n * Depending on the status it'll show a different modal.\r\n *\r\n * ### How to use it?\r\n * To avoid repeating this kind of code:\r\n * ```\r\n * const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\r\n * const [status, setStatus] = useState('loading')\r\n * ```\r\n * You can use the hook that comes with the component:\r\n * ```\r\n * const { isOpen, status, dispatch } = useWaitingDialog()\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * If you want to update `isOpen` or `status`, you can do like so:\r\n * ```\r\n * // Set isOpen = false\r\n * dispatch({ type: \"close\" })\r\n *\r\n * // Set isOpen = true & status = 'loading | success | error'\r\n * dispatch({ type: \"open\", payload: { status: 'loading | success | error' }})\r\n *\r\n * // Set status = 'loading | success | error'\r\n * dispatch({ type: \"status\", payload: { status: 'loading | success | error' }})\r\n * ```\r\n */\r\nconst WaitingDialog = ({\r\n    open,\r\n    status,\r\n    titles,\r\n    texts,\r\n    gifs,\r\n
